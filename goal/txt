✅ What Kind of NPM Package You Could Build
Here are some beginner to mid-level ideas you can actually publish:

MERN-related Packages
react-timeline-ui – A timeline component for project tracking

mongo-schema-to-json – Convert Mongoose schema to JSON formats

jwt-role-guard – A simple React-based route guard using JWT roles

react-quiz-core – The quiz logic you already built as a package

Testing / Automation
cy-api-tester – A wrapper to write Cypress API tests faster

form-autotest – A CLI tool that fills common forms for test automation

Utilities
excel-json-exporter – Export UI table data to Excel/JSON with MUI

env-checker-cli – A CLI to validate .env variables before deploy

Need help picking the right one? I can shortlist 3 package ideas based on what you've already built.
